The Bit One ESP32 Kit is an original shield to learn how to use the fantastic ESP32 microcontroller. A shield is an electronic card that provides new capabilities and utilities for development boards.
With the electrical configurations used in Bit One ESP32 we expand the functionalities of the ESP32 DevKitC development card. You will have a modular development environment with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, compatible with the Arduino IDE programming environment and libraries.

The Bit One ESP32 Kit is an original shield to learn how to use the fantastic ESP32 microcontroller. 
With the electrical configurations used in Bit One ESP32 we expand the functionalities of the ESP32 DevKitC development board. You will have a modular development environment with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, compatible with the Arduino IDE programming environment and libraries.

The Bit One ESP32 shield contains the basic elements to allow the initiation of anyone with an interest in learning electronics. The Bit One ESP32 board is powered by 5V (DC).

## Characteristic
- Supply voltage: 5V DC.

- Representation of a digital dice through 7 leds and a button.

- Representation of a traffic light through 3 leds.

- 4 analog ports (can be configured as digital GPIOs as well).

- 2 I2C communication ports.

- One UART communication port.

- 4 GPIO ports to connect servo motors.

- An OLED screen of 0.96 inches and 128x64 characters.

- Dimension: 64x82 (mm).

- Diameter of the fixing holes: 3mm (x3).
